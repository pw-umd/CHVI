# Climate health vulnerability index


This folder includes R programming code and partial aggregated data for the paper "Climate health vulnerability index: an updated modeling framework and sensitivity analysis of methodology."

Data sources and manipulation of all indicators used to construct the climate health vulnerability index in the case study are fully described in Supplementary Information. Most data sources are publicly available, with the exception of five health indicators, which must be requested from the New York State Department of Health.
